# Mushroom Edibility Project

## National University ANA500

## Elijah C Walker

## Prof. E Rodriguez

This is a four part data science project using Python (Jupyter Notebook), Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow intended to define the characteristics most definitive of mushrooms that are either poisonous or edible. Using machine learning algorithms, predictive models are made to define which characteristics are the greatest indicators of the mushrooms edibility. As the other parts of the project are created, this repo and README.md file will grow to contain further information and charts.

The dataset can be found here:

## Micro-Project 1

Step 1: Acquire

-   Find a data analytics problem and supporting dataset
-   Import data and libraries
-   Outline an approach for analysis
-   Define the null and alternative hypothesis
-   Develop a flowchart to support the approach
-   Pseudocode

Step 2: Prepare

-   Perform exploratory data analysis
-   Preprocess data as needed
-   Gain an understanding of the data
-   Manipulate data into a state for algorithms

## Micro-Project 2

Step 3: Analyze and Visualize

-   Implement algorithms (Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression)
-   Create supporting visualizations
-   Determine coefficient weights and other meaningful influencers to the outcome

Step 4: Report

-   Report results
